# Description
This is my blog created using Pelican, a python based static site generator. https://docs.getpelican.com/

# Setup
* Install Python 3 (Most recent tested version 3.10.5)
* Clone this repo into a directory of your choice. Navigate to that folder in terminal window.
* Create a virtual environment. https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html 
  * py -m venv env
* Install Pelican (Most recent tested version 4.7.2)
  * py -m pip install "pelican[markdown]"
* Optional utility for publishing to github pages: Install ghp-import: 
  * py -m pip install "ghp-import"
* Set git origin for blog code. Likely not needed if cloning from github.
  * git remote add origin https://github.com/spmuck/spmuck-blog.git
* Optional for publishing to github pages: Set ghp remote to publish to github pages by pushing to the ghp master branch.
  * git remote add ghp https://github.com/spmuck/spmuck.github.io.git


# To publish to github pages.
* Build Site
  * pelican content 
    * (default parameters are equal to pelican content -o output -s pelicanconf.py)
* Verify site is as expected. Use ghp-import tool to export the output folder generated by pelican to the local gh-pages git branch.
  * ghp-import output -b gh-pages
* Push local gh-pages branch to ghp remote master branch. This will publish the changes to my personal github pages site.
  * git push ghp gh-pages:master
